#Logistic System

## Purpose
Yeah, the Project Name...
This Qt Toy Project was made with the objective to learn Qt5 Framework
and the QML FE features to get experience with all the Free Capabilities.
To fulfill this goal, this toy project has the goal of the creation of a 
complete administration app for a company who works on any kind of 
product transportation.

The basic idea is create a system to handle all the:

1. Clients
2. Providers
3. Accounting
4. Vehicles
5. Drivers
6. Routes
7. Warehouse

## Ok, With that said...
This Project has a Huge amount of Design Errors that are understandable to
point out, but, that's why is a Toy Project. I have a lot to apply, from
more design patterns, SOLID Principles and Unit Testing.
This design flaws would be registered as ISSUES on a Bitbucket Repo that I
use as In Progrees Development Projects or Practices.
